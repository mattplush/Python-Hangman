# Python-Hangman

This is a simple hangman game written in python. The game starts by loading the english dictionary. A merge sort is then used on the words to sort them by length. The user selects the difficulty (easy, medium, hard), and a subset of these words is used. For easy, the word may be 1 - 7 characters long, 8 - 14 characters long for medium, and 15 - 21 characters long for hard. The program ends when a game is fully played out.
